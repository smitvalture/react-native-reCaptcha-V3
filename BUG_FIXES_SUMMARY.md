# Bug Fixes Summary for React Native reCAPTCHA V3

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **ESLint Configuration Update**
- **Issue**: ESLint v9 requires a new configuration format (eslint.config.js instead of .eslintrc)
- **Fix**: Created a new `eslint.config.js` file with the proper v9 format and installed missing dependencies (@eslint/js, eslint-plugin-react)

### 2. **Missing Dependency in useEffect**
- **Issue**: The `executeReCaptcha` function was used inside `useEffect` but not included in the dependency array, which could lead to stale closures
- **Fix**: Wrapped `executeReCaptcha` in `React.useCallback` and added it to the dependency arrays of both `useEffect` and `useImperativeHandle`

### 3. **Invalid Default Site Key**
- **Issue**: The component had a default `siteKey` of `'dummy-site-key'` which would not work with Google reCAPTCHA
- **Fix**: Removed the default value and added validation to throw an error if `siteKey` is not provided

### 4. **Memory Leak from setTimeout**
- **Issue**: The `setTimeout` calls in the `useEffect` were not cleaned up when the component unmounts, potentially causing memory leaks
- **Fix**: 
  - Added a `timeoutIds` ref to store timeout IDs
  - Added a cleanup function in the `useEffect` return to clear all timeouts on unmount

### 5. **TypeScript Type Issues**
- **Issue**: Using `NodeJS.Timeout[]` type which is not available in React Native environment
- **Fix**: Changed to `ReturnType<typeof setTimeout>[]` which is more portable and works across environments

### 6. **Code Formatting Issues**
- **Issue**: Code had inconsistent formatting that didn't match the project's Prettier configuration
- **Fix**: Ran ESLint with --fix flag to automatically format the code according to the project's style guide

## Verification

All fixes have been verified by:
- ✅ TypeScript type checking passes (`yarn typecheck`)
- ✅ ESLint passes with no errors (`yarn lint`)
- ✅ Project builds successfully (`yarn prepare`)

## Recommendations

1. Consider adding unit tests to verify the timeout cleanup behavior
2. Add documentation about the required `siteKey` prop in the README
3. Consider adding prop-types or better TypeScript validation for runtime prop checking
4. Add error boundary to gracefully handle the thrown error when siteKey is missing
